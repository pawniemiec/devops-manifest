# Logging

Logging - as per [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)#Event_logging_versus_tracing)

In software engineering, tracing involves a specialized use of logging
to record information about a program's execution. This information is
typically used by programmers for debugging purposes, and additionally,
depending on the type and detail of information contained in a trace log,
by experienced system administrators or technical-support personnel and
by software monitoring tools to diagnose common problems with software.

## Format

Each application had global common logging function used across all modules.

Format of logging should be consistent across all environments and 

```sh
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ZZZ [<LOG_LEVEL>] <message>
```

## Levels and usage

The following LOG_LEVELâ€™s will be used:

- `DEBUG` - troubleshooting integration issues
  - DEV environment
  - SIT environment
- `INFO` - main functions of program
  - Staging environment
  - Production environment
- `WARN`
  - Production environment
- `ERROR`
  - Production environment

Logging < LEVEL > is being read from Environment Variable `LOG_LEVEL` upon deployment.

## Location

All logging from docker images goes to `STDOUT` (both `STDERR` and `STDOUT`)

Container cluster grabs all logs sent to `STDOUT` and posts them
to [Logging System](https://<logging_system_URL>/)
