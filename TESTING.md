# Testing
We are aiming for all tests to be automated and build into build pipeline


### Functional testing

##### Unit testing
Each function should have unit tests written covering as many edge cases as possible.
100% code test coverage is not possible in real world, byt we are aiming for it.

##### Integration testing
E2E tests
When some sort of unit testing is not possible, end-to-end tests should cover the gap.

##### System testing

##### Sanity testing

##### Smoke testing

##### Interface testing

##### Regression testing

##### Beta/Acceptance testing


### Non-functional testing

##### Performance Testing

##### Load testing

##### Stress testing

##### Volume testing

##### Security testing

##### Compatibility testing

##### Install testing

##### Recovery testing

##### Reliability testing

##### Accessibility testing
